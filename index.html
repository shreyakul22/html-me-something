                    Internet is an amazing tool for finding inspiration and ideas for your home. 
                    However, it can be extremely overwhelming when you're trying to find things that would work 
                    for you and your home. It's easy to fall into the rabbit hole of  Social Media!

                <p>  When I started decorating my home, my initial thoughts were modern + classic + something that looks like my space.
                     There was ocean of choices out there but its just not for me. While creating this space I wanted it to look cozy, warm and home. 
                    I call it coffee room because we sit here together and enjoy having coffee while admiring the beautiful scenic view outside our window..</p>

                        <h2>More Tips</h2>

                <p>I love a fake plant that makes the room extra cozy. I also love good table decor and a glass coffee table to show up the area rug. 
                    Also a lucite bar cart is great for multi use and keeps things visually light. 
                    Of course, always a party when there is a well stocked bar cart!

                            The farmhouse-modern look is all about the perfectly imperfect. This white rough-hewn wood barn door—an unexpected addition to a spacious 
                            farmhouse guest room—along with the poured-concrete floors and railing-thin metal bed frames reference dexterous handwork.
                             Consider mixing these elements within one space for a sleek-meets-salvaged look that’s polished and unfussy all at once.
